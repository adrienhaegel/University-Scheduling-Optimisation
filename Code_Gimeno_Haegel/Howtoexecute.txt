Our code can be run as asked in the project description:

The solver is "java jar\Solver.jar", and can be called using:

java -jar Solver.jar basic.utt courses.utt lecturers.utt rooms.utt curricula.utt relation.utt unavailability.utt 300 > Solution.sol

(All the utt files should be in the same folder as Solver.jar)
A batch file directly calling it is also provided in the same folder.
